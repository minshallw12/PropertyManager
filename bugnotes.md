# Bugs

- manager form does not reset fields to empy after form submit. Get rid of the react-bootstrap?
- manager list does not automatically rerender when a new manager has been added. Use a useEffect?
- property list does not automatically rerender whena a new property has been added.
- total cost does not populate correctly. Delete this feature?

- street and purchase_cost do not update although the put call does function.
