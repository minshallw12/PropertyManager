# Bugs

- manager form does not reset fields to empty after form submit. Get rid of the react-bootstrap?
- manager list does not automatically rerender when a new manager has been added. Use a useEffect?
- property list does not automatically rerender when a new property has been added.

- improper user auth allows bad sign in to access navbar
